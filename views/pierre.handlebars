  <div class="project-description">
    One of the most stressful times for high school seniors is the college
    application process.
    High school students would benefit from being exposed to honest
    college experiences before making a decision regarding college.
    Over a course of 10 weeks, me and two others created a mobile
    web application that allows high school students to connect
    to college students and will be able to learn and chat more about
    the personal college experience. I created most of the visual design
    of this project and conducted the user testing.

    <h3> 1. Needfinding </h3>
    <div class="divider2"> </div>
    <div class="project-description">
    First I observed a few people who performed tasks that relate
    to the idea of exchange. Exchange could be both tangible and
    intangible - a laptop, clothes, memories, knowledge, advice, etc.
    After observing my users, I brainstormed a list of specific
    user needs.
    </div>

<div class="step-2">
  <h3> 2. Prototyping </h3>
  <div class="divider2"> </div>
  <div class="project-description">
  After creating a list of user needs, we created a team inspiration
  board. The inspiration board helped us understanding the existing
  landscape, like a competitive analysis. This inspiration board included
  websites such as Reddit, UCSD Career Advice, a Mentor-Mentee Program,
  College Confidential, and College Board. Next, we used our inspirations
  to come up with two different design ideas illustrated on a storyboard.
  (Advice Pro was our old application name)

  Next, we built two paper prototypes. </br>

  Prototype 1 is more of creating an appointment with
  a college student based on your own interests, while
  prototype 2 is more forum-like.

  <div class="step-3">
    <h3> 3. Heuristic Evaluation </h3>
    <div class="divider3"> </div>
    <div class="project-description">
      Using Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics, we
      recruited a few people to evaluate our prototypes. This process help
      identify usability problems in our early prototype of the user interface
      design. Major problems that we found was that we had a poor navigation
      system, misleading language, and not a lot of freedom for when
      the student wanted to create an appointment. Although this was just an
      early design, we learned how to think more like the user and how to make
      our interface have the best user experience.
    </br></br>
      Here's a sample: </br><center>

  <h3> 4. Building the Website </h3>
  <div class="divider3"> </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    Here's a picture of our first developed home page: </br></br> <center>

<!--  <img src="/images/home_1.png" width="25%"> -->
</br></br>  </center>
I know, it looks pretty lame. At first, our group did not have
good communication, which then caused everyone to be on different pages.
One person believed that the navigation bar wasn't necessary, so he deleted
it without telling the rest of the team members! In addition, the navigation
bar was only deleted on certain pages, which caused inconsistency. We received
a really bad grade for that first turn in assignment (we definitely learned
out lesson) because of our poor communication. We spent about five weeks
to create and develop the website. 


</br></br>
The tools that we used:
<ol>
  <li> HTML </li>
  <li> CSS </li>
  <li> Javascript </li>
  <li> Google Analytics </li>
  <li> Mongo Database </li>
  <li> Github </li>
  </ol>

<div class="step-5">
  <h3> 5. User Testing </h3>
  <div class="divider2"> </div>
  <div class="project-description">
    We tested our prototype with a few users to find ways
    to improve the interface of our app.
  </br></br>

    <img src="/images/user_test1.png" width="45%">
    <img src="/images/user_quote.jpg" width="50%">
  </br></br>
  </center>
    <div class="step-5-2">
    One very important inconsistency we discovered from this phase of user
    testing was with our login and create account functions which
    tended to cause confusion with the flow of the interaction.
    To further test whether this was a user anomaly or an issue
    with the application, we turned to online testing to perform a
     A/B test using Google Analytics. We redesigned the create
     account page and tested the number of accounts that was
     created of using the redesigned and our original design.
     From our results, the redesigned page did not make a difference.
     I learned that using Google Analytics was not very helpful as I
     thought it would be, but I will probably give it another shot
     on my next project. Data collection was very slow; they only
     give results on the daily!

      <h3> 7. Conclusion </h3>
      <div class="divider2"> </div>
      <div class="project-description">
        Overall, this was my first design project & I loved it! I learned a lot
        about both the design process and web development. Prototyping and
        storyboarding allows me to test my users and get a better
        idea of the problem. Design is a process that changes overtime; my first
        functional prototype looks totally different from the final product!
        User testing helps designers understand how people use the product and
        allows us to see what changes we should make to create the best
        user experience. I am excited to further expand my knowledge on design
        and help implement beautiful and improved
        user experiences! :)
